# CSS Compression [VERSION] Change Log
# [DATE]
# Corey Hart @ http://www.codenothing.com

# New Features
- Configuration Modes
- pseduo-space, add space after pseduo selectors for ie6
- removing leading 0 of a decimal, 0.633px -> .633px
- handling ms filter paths

# Enhancements
- Now handling all '@' prefixes (charsets,media,imports,font-family,etc..)
- Removed sketchy include method in unit testing, all selectors/details defined inside function
- Helper conversion definitions(long2hex, hex2short) are now in JSON based files.


# Possible Breaks
- Removing 'rm-multi-define' option, compression is worthless without it.
