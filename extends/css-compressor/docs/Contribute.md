==========

This project is always in dire need of help in any form, I only have 2 rules:

- All unit tests must pass.

For nix users: From the root directroy, run 'make test-all'  
For windows users: Run 'php unit/start.php all'

- Tab character indentations

I don't care if you like 2,3,4,8,16 spaced indentation, just make sure it's a tab character and not spaces.
